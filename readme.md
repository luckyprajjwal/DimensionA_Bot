eg: 
```python
def next_class(message):
  # message content is like 'next EE'
  x = message.content.split(' ')
  subject = x[1]
  #subject can be codes like, 'COA' or 'EE' 'DBMS' 'CN' 
  # 'OS' 'FD'
  # now find when the next class and time that subject is
  #and just display the time as

  x =' Tuesday from xx:xx to xx:xx '
  await message.channel.send(f"> {x}")

  # oe lucky tero kaam la yeti gar paila terai 
  #computer mai 
  #gar ani bhayo bhane bhan malai
  
  #you are not allowed to change the data.py file at all
  #if you change it i will block you.
